# Let's Get Rusty Bootcamp Projects

The three projects found in here were completed as a part of the bootcamp taught by Bogdan of "Let's Get Rusty".

One is a CLI application that mimics the behaviour of Jira, one is a WEB API made with a Rocket server, and one is an example of a Microservices styled application.
