# Jira Clone

This project begins with starter files provided by the Lets Get Rusty Developer Bootcamp.  The student builds out the planned functionality by completing TODO items found throughout the code.

The initial commit will be of only the starting files having been set up, in their state before having begun work on them.


The project aims to build two primary features like those of Jira:

1. The ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete an Epic

2. The ability to Create, Read, Update, and Delete a Story


The goals of this project are to practice the following:

- Building a CLI app in rust
- Reading and writing to disk
- Using third-party crates (serde, anyhow, itertools, etc)
- Writing testable code
- Organizing code using modules
- Navigating and contributing to an existing code base
